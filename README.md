## What is JETVerified?
JETVerified is a platform for individuals and organisations to carry out safe and secure transactions without the worry

Since the invention of technology, hackers and bots, have always managed
 to bypass even the sophisticated identity database storing data for for business clients.
This has resulted in the loss of significant amount of
 money and, in other ways, eroding customer trust. This in part is also due to failure of these in keeping individual identities
for their clients as a result of poor verification system.

JETVerified is the place for these kind of businesses as well as individuals. We also offer various services like marketplace for users to buy and sell items, employer verification for organizations, and many more

## How does it work?
At JETVerified, we use a decentralised data storage platform to alleviate the problem of hackers getting into our database.
We also make use of state of the art verification system provided by verified.Africa which offers easy-to-use API's for NIN verification, BVN verification, international passport verification as well as facials verification and many more
Exploiting these advantages we have built a platform safe enough for users and business to use for the various transactions.
